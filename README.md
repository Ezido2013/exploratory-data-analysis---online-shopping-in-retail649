## Table of Contents
- Introduction
    This project encompasses an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of online customer activities from a retail company. The process includes an extract data from AWS RDS, detailed EDA using Python, and culminates in a comprehensive business report providing insights.

- Description of the Project:
 - The Aim of the project
    The aim of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) project is to comprehensively analyze the online customer activity dataset from a retail company. The goal is to extract meaningful insights and patterns from the data, understand customer behaviors, and identify potential business opportunities to enhance customer engagement and drive sales growth. This analysis will include data extraction from AWS RDS, data cleaning and transformation, statistical analysis, and data visualization, ultimately culminating in a detailed business report.

 - What I have learned
    Data Extraction and Transformation:
    I have gained proficiency in setting up an ELT pipeline to extract data from AWS RDS, ensuring efficient and secure data retrieval. I have learned best practices for data cleaning and transformation, including handling missing values, correcting data types, and normalizing data for analysis.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Techniques:
    I have developed skills in using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for conducting thorough exploratory data analysis. I have also enhanced ability to identify and interpret patterns, trends, and outliers within the dataset, providing a solid foundation for data-driven decision-making.

    Statistical Analysis and Visualization:
    I have acquired knowledge in applying various statistical methods to summarize and infer data properties, including correlation analysis and hypothesis testing. My competency in creating effective visualizations that convey complex information clearly and concisely have improved, facilitating better understanding and communication of data insights.

    Project Management and Documentation:
    Enhanced project management skills by organizing and documenting each step of the EDA process, ensuring reproducibility and transparency. Developed the ability to present data-driven stories that align with business goals, supporting strategic planning and decision-making.
Overall, this project provided a robust understanding of the end-to-end process of data analysis, from data extraction to delivering valuable business insights, equipping me with practical skills applicable to real-world data challenges.

- Installation instructions
    Environment Setup
    After creating the custom environment for this project, I installed pip and used the pip install command to download from the PyPI library all the necessary modules and dependencies. For this project dependencies, users can download by running following commands:

        conda create --name myenv python=3.8
        conda activate myenv
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    To Clone Repository
    git clone repo-url

- Usage instructions
    Ensure that your environment has internet access to download the necessary Python packages from PyPI.
    Make sure you have the necessary permissions and access rights to connect to the AWS RDS database.
    Modify the scripts as needed to fit your specific data and analysis requirements.
By following these instructions, you will be able to set up the environment, extract data, perform exploratory data analysis, and generate a business report with actionable insights.
